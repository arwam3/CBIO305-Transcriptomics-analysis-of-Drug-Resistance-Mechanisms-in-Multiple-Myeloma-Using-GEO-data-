## :pushpin: Overview

This project investigates transcriptomic alterations underlying **carfilzomib resistance** in **multiple myeloma (MM)** using microarray data from the GEO database (**GSE69078**). The analysis focuses on identifying **differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** and associated **autophagy-related survival mechanisms**, including those regulated by **KLF4** and **SQSTM1/p62**.

## :clipboard: Workflow

1. **Microarray preprocessing:** QC, normalization, and expression matrix construction using Bioconductor.  
2. **DEA:** Differential expression using the `limma` package.  
3. **Enrichment:** GO/KEGG pathway analysis and PPI network construction.  
4. **Visualization:** Volcano plots, UMAP, PCA, and heatmaps.

## :bar_chart: Visualization and Interpretation

### Figure 2: Box Plot & Heatmap
- **A.** The box plot shows that the overall distribution of gene expression levels (log2 transformed) is remarkably similar across all four sample groups: KMS 11 control, KMS 11 resistant, KMS 34 control, and KMS 34 resistant. The medians, interquartile ranges, and overall spread of the data points within each group appear consistent.
- **B.**  The heatmap visually represents the expression levels of genes identified as differentially expressed (DEGs).
- **C.** he histogram shows the distribution of adjusted p-values from the differential gene expression analysis. A "good" p-value distribution for a differential expression analysis typically shows a peak near 0 and a relatively flat distribution for higher p-values (approaching 1)

### Figure 3 : MD Plot

- **A. KMS-11 Resistant vs Control:**  
Most genes show minimal change, but some are significantly up- or downregulated (logFC > ¬±1), indicating selective gene expression changes associated with resistance.

- **B. KMS-34 Resistant vs Control:**  
Stronger transcriptional shifts are observed, with many genes showing logFC > ¬±2, suggesting a more robust resistance-associated response.

- **C. KMS-11 vs KMS-34 Resistant:**  
Major expression differences (logFC > ¬±4) reveal distinct resistance mechanisms between the two cell lines.

### Figure 4 : Volcano Plot

- **A. KMS-11 Resistant vs Control:**  
Moderate differential expression is observed, with significant genes showing log2 fold change > ¬±1 and -log10 adjusted p-value > 2.

- **B. KMS-34 Resistant vs Control:**  
Stronger expression changes are seen, with many genes exceeding log2 fold change ¬±2.5 and -log10 p-value > 6.

- **C. KMS-11 vs KMS-34 Resistant:**  
Extensive expression differences, with numerous genes showing log2 fold change > ¬±6 and high significance (-log10 p-value > 10).

### Figure 5 : PCA & UMAP

- The UMAP shows clear separation between KMS-11 and KMS-34 samples, and between control and resistant groups, highlighting distinct expression profiles across both cell lines and treatment conditions.  
- PCA reveals strong clustering by both cell line and resistance status.  
- This distinct separation supports robust differences in gene expression driven by both cell type and resistance development.
